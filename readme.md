# getreal.c

A command-line tool written in C for decrypting/encrypting patterns in
S3M files, as seen in the music files for the 1993 demo Second Reality:
* [MUSIC0.S3M](https://github.com/mtuomi/SecondReality/raw/master/MAIN/MUSIC0.S3M)
* [MUSIC1.S3M](https://github.com/mtuomi/SecondReality/raw/master/MAIN/MUSIC1.S3M)

To compile on Linux, or some other decent OS, run `./make.sh`.

To compile on Windows, idk good luck with that.

Usage (for current version, might change in the future):

```bash
getreal <inputfile> <outputfile>
```
